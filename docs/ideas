*Mutation set&: some sort of built-in property that provides a set of variables a
function can mutate. This would provide a mechanism to assert some level of
purity upon a function via unit tests without burdening the naive programmer.
This would also allow greater architectural introspection for software designers.

usage:
    myfunc.mutations.equals([myvar, myothervar])
    a.mymethod.mutations.equals([myglobal, a.mymember])

for C or external functions either the mutation set wont exist, or it will
consist of a meta-variable 'extern'
